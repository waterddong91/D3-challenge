## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."


## D3 Dabbler

Created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Used the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. Coded this graphic in the `app.js` file and pulled in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. The final scatter plot ultimately appears like the image at the top of this section.

* State abbreviations is included in the circles.

* X/Y Axes and labels is created and situated to the left and bottom of the chart.
